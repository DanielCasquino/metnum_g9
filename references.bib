  abstract = {This paper investigates the cost requirement for a space debris collecting mission aimed at removing heavy debris from low Earth orbits. The problem mixes combinatorial optimization to select the debris among a list of candidates and functional optimization to define the orbital manoeuvres. The solving methodology proceeds in two steps: Firstly, a specific transfer strategy with impulsive manoeuvres is defined so that the problem becomes of finite dimension; secondly the problem is linearized around an initial reference solution. A Branch and Bound algorithm is then applied iteratively to optimize simultaneously the debris selection and the orbital manoeuvres, yielding a new reference solution. The optimal solutions found are close to the initial guess despite a very complicated design space. The method is exemplified on a representative application case.}

abstract = {The problem of two-tangent-impulse space target flyby is drawn in this paper. Unlike the traditional method, the transfer orbit is divided into two parts, i.e. the phasing orbit and the approaching orbit, considering the temporal and the spatial constraint respectively. The method of the phasing orbit and approaching orbit determination is formulated firstly. Then, the attainable target areas from a given position on the initial elliptic orbit, the feasible impulse position for approaching to a given point in space and the optimal approaching orbit to a given point are analyzed. Based on the optimal approaching orbit, the optimal solution for target flyby is provided in the time free case, and a suboptimal solution for the case of time-constrained. Numerical simulations demonstrate the application of the solutions to space target flyby in different scenarios.}

abstract = {Accurate and highly efficient approaches to obtain mission opportunities are still the goals of mission planners of interplanetary explorations. The search for launch opportunities not only determines the specified launch window of the mission but also presents the performance requirements for the interplanetary probe and its launch vehicle. An effective method, namely the two-dimensional launch window method, is developed from a completely new perspective to determine all the launch opportunities of the mission in this research. For a fixed launch time, the method to determine all the time windows in the dimension of Time-of-Flight (TOF) is firstly proposed and these time windows represent all the launch opportunities for the given launch time. And then, the two-dimensional launch window method is proposed, which computes the time windows in both the launch time and TOF dimensions to achieve all launch opportunities of the mission. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and high efficiency of the method. Compared with the widely-used pock-chop plot method, the proposed method reduces the computational time by two orders of magnitude for the same search precision, and thus is especially suitable for the cases involving rapid, high-precision, and/or large-scale searches for mission opportunities.}
